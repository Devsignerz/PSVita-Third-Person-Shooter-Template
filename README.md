# PSVita-Third-Person-Shooter-Template
third person shooter template i'm creating and using for the game i'm working on for the legendary PS VIta!

keep in mind this is made with unity 2018.2.19f1

i have the controls guide for ps vita in the controls.txt file.

to setup the build.bat file, use this template:

	"your UnityTools.exe file location" -i ./build -o build -f -u -r -p -d
	mkdir build
	move ./build.vpk "where you want to move the vpk file in your ps vita"
